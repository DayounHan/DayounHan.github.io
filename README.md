Movie recommendation system based on filtering using TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset. 

Three types of recommender systems -
1) Demographic filtering - use movie popularity and/or genre. The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. The basic idea of this is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the avg audience.

2) Content Based Filtering - suggest similar items based on a particular item. This sytem uses item metadata such as genre, director, description, actors, etc.

3) Collaborative Filtering - This system matches persons with similar interests and provides recommendations based on this matching. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts.
